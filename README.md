# Orbiter Skybolt Client
A 3d graphics client plugin for the [Orbiter](https://github.com/orbitersim/orbiter) space flight simulator which allows Orbiter to render with the [Skybolt](https://github.com/Piraxus/Skybolt) engine.

This project is in early development and many Orbiter graphics features are not yet supported.

## Build
### Using conan
[Conan](https://conan.io) is a C++ package manager which makes builds easier.
Currently, the build requires conan version 1.x. We plan to upgrade to 2.x in the future.
If you do not already have conan 1.x installed, run `pip install conan==1.64.1` to install using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip).

Build with the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/piraxus/Skybolt
git -C Skybolt checkout v1.4.1
conan export Skybolt

git clone https://github.com/Piraxus/OrbiterSkyboltClient
conan install OrbiterSkyboltClient --install-folder OrbiterSkyboltClientBuild --build=missing
conan build OrbiterSkyboltClient --build-folder OrbiterSkyboltClientBuild
```

The plugin is built to `OrbiterSkyboltClientBuild/bin/Release/OrbiterSkyboltClient.dll`.

## Install
1. Copy `OrbiterSkyboltClient.dll` to `<Orbiter repo>/Modules/Plugin`
2. Copy `<Skybolt repo>/Assets/Core` to `<Orbiter repo>/Modules/Plugin/OrbiterSkyboltClient/Assets/Core`
3. `cd` to the `SkyboltOrbiterClient` repository root and run `dvc pull` to fetch the remote binary assets (images etc required at runtime). If you do not already have DVC installed, first run `pip install dvc[s3]` to install with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip)
4. Copy all folders under `<SkyboltOrbiterClient repo>/Assets` to `<Orbiter repo>/Modules/Plugin/OrbiterSkyboltClient/Assets`
